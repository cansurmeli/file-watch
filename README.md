# FileWatch
This was the security project I've developed when I was taking my computer security lecture. It demonstrates authentication and confidentiality concepts for files under OS X.

It's nowhere near a complete security application and does not provide any guarantees regarding that manner. It just demonstrates the concepts and I'm sharing it for anyone interested in the subject.

Please feel free to fork the project and come up with ideas!


P.S. sorry for the primitive UI. it's not my style, I deeply care about UI/UX but for the purpose of catching up with the deadline of the project back when I was developing, I came up with this shitty one. Probably I'll design a better one in the future.
