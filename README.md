# FileWatch
This was the security project I've developed when I was taking my computer security lecture. It demonstrates authentication and confidentiality concepts for files under OS X.

It's nowhere near a complete security application and does not provide any guarantees regarding that manner. It just demonstrates the concepts and I'm sharing it for anyone interested in the subject.

Please feel free to fork the project and come up with ideas!
